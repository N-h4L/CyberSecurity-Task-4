# Cyber Security Internship – Task 4

## 📌 Task Title
Password Security & Authentication Analysis

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Kali Linux
- John the Ripper
- Hash Identifier
- Wordlists (rockyou)

## 🎯 Objective
To understand how passwords are stored using hashing, analyze weak password vulnerabilities, and study common password attack techniques along with strong authentication defenses.

## 📚 Task Overview
This task focuses on analyzing password security by:
- Learning the difference between hashing and encryption
- Identifying common hash types such as MD5 and SHA-1
- Generating password hashes
- Cracking weak hashes using dictionary-based attacks
- Understanding brute force vs dictionary attacks
- Studying the importance of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)

All practical experiments were performed on **self-created test passwords** for educational purposes.

## 🔐 Key Learnings
- Weak passwords can be cracked quickly using common wordlists
- Hashing is a one-way process and differs from encryption
- Dictionary attacks are faster than brute force attacks
- MFA significantly improves account security even if passwords are compromised

## ✅ Learning Outcome
- Practical understanding of password attacks
- Awareness of secure password practices
- Knowledge of authentication defenses such as MFA
